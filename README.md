# FullStack_MutualFundsWebAppRestFulAPI_JavaJSPJSMySQL
Built a Dynamic J2EE Mutual Fund Web Application accessible to buy/sell funds etc. I implemented the transition day use case, carrying out the CRUD operations of the pending transactions based on the closing fund price, handling concurrency using generic Daoâ€™s Database Transactions. Wrote a custom comparator classes to retrieve, sort and display transactions history. Wrote defensive code to handle HTML and SQL injection attacks. Cloud Deployed the web application using AWS EC2 instance. Exposed the functionality of the mutual fund web application we built by implementing a RESTful Web Service API in Java using the Jersey Framework. Tested acceptance of the system using an Artillery script.
